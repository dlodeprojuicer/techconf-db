Hybrid mobile template built with ([latest](https://ionicframework.com/blog/announcing-the-new-ionic-vue-beta/)) vue-ionic and using capacitor for native builds - These templates are from app design inspiration pages on Instagram or Dribble.

Template is inspired by the new Capitec Bank app. Capitec is one of the largest banks in South Africa. It provides personal banking services through its 1000-plus branches across the country. For this template the focus is on the general look and feel.

Using [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/getting-started) for native builds

### Prepare native builds

## iOS testing and distribution
1. Download latest Xcode
2. `npm run build`
3. `npx cap add ios`
3. `npx cap copy`
4. `npx cap open ios` Xcode takes a few minutes to index the files; keep an eye at the top of Xcode's window for progress.

[Not compulsory] For sanity check click on the play button in top left. This will prepare and run the app in a simulator, if all goes well you should be able to login and click around. If not, create an issue ðŸ¤· and I will have a look.

*Icons and launch images* - Xcode (v11.5) cannot map icons listed in config.xml so this has to be done manually ðŸ˜ž. In the root folder look for Resources and select Images.xcassets. A panel will show up where you can select AppIcon to add app icons or LaunchImage to add launch images.

## Android testing and distribution
1. Download latest Android Studio
2. `npm run build`
3. `npx cap add android`
3. `npx cap copy`
4. `npx cap open android` Android Studio takes a few minutes to index the files, keep an eye at the bottom of Android Studio for progress.
5. Testing - When indexing is complete, look for a green play button. Click the play button and it will launch the app in an emulator ([See here to setup Emulator](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds)) or on the phone if a phone is connected via USB.
